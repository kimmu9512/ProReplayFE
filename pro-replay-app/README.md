# ProReplay Frontend

This is the frontend for [ProReplay](#). The corresponding backend for ProReplay can be found [here](https://github.com/kimmu9512/ProReplay).

**Note**: The backend must be running in order for the frontend to work properly.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
